<li>To use Flip, you will need to declare a model. The chapter <a href="../guide/declare.md">Declaring the Model</a> exposes the basic principles to do so</li>
<li>Before going on with manipulating a model, the chapter <a href="../guide/organize.md">Organizing the Code</a> gives a brief overview on how to layout your code for subsequent work</li>
<li>Once this is setup, the chapter <a href="../guide/control.md">Controlling the Model</a> exposes the way to control (that is, modify) the model</li>
<li>Once you can control the model, the chapter <a href="../guide/observe.md">Observing the Model</a> exposes the way to listen to model modifications</li>
<li>Next, the chapter <a href="../guide/remote.md">Working with a Remote Server</a> explains how to interact with a remote server and allow collaboration between multiple clients</li>
<li>Finally the chapter <a href="../guide/misc.md">More Fun with Flip</a> leverage the full power of the flip transactional and document model and the problems you can solve with it</li>
