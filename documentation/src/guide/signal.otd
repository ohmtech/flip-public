\chapter [id=signal] {Signalling the Model}


Now that we can control the model with persistent data, this chapter exposes
how to control the model with non-persistent data, that is data that is not
going to be saved. There multiple ways to achieve that in flip, with
slightly different meaning, exposed here.

This chapter will use the model declared in the chapter \link [id=declare] {Declaring the Model}.

\section [id=which] {\code {Signal} and \code {Message}}

Flip has two signal types : \link [id=reference/Signal] {\code {Signal}}
and \link [id=reference/Message] {\code {Message}}. They operate
in a relative similar ways, but have different meanings.

\subsection [id=message] {\code {Message}}

\link [id=reference/Message] {\code {Message}} is a flip type. It does not store data, but allows to
share non-persitent data between clients. For this reason, it is part
of the document model.

When a \code {Message} is signalled, the content of the data is shared with
every documents and clients connected to the same document, but the data itself
is not saved within the document.

A \code {Message} describes a transient change of state of a flip Object.
Receiving the data sent is done through the observer, as a \code {Message} is
part of the model, which means that the data from a message is in a transaction
where over members might be changed. This allows to receive synchronously
changes of the model, that would be hard to manage with a \code {Signal}.

Let's take an example to illustrate this point. Let's consider a play head
in a audio or video application. From a feature point of view, the play head
has a position and a state (playing or not playing). The position expresses
the change in the model, not the actual position as shown in the view.

If suddenly the user want to change both the position and the state of
the play head, then using a \code {Message} ensure that those two properties
are going to be changed synchronously and transactionally into the model.

This is not the case with \code {Signal} where those changes would come
one after the other, possibly in a different order.

Example :

\codeblock [language=c++] ***
class PlayHead : public Object
{
public:
   enum State
   {
      State_STOPPED = 0,
      State_PLAYING,
   };

   Float position;
   Message <State> state;
};

// controlling the model, jumping to position 2.0
// and playing at the same time

auto & playhead = song.playhead;
playhead.position = 2.0;
playhead.state.send (PlayHead::State_PLAYING);

playhead.document ().commit ();


// observing the model, this allow to see the
// changes as a transaction

void  document_changed (PlayHead & playhead)
{
   if (playhead.position.changed ())
   {
      // ...
   }

   if (playhead.state.changed ())
   {
      playhead.state.get ([&](bool forward_flag, State state) {
         // ...
      });
   }
}
***

Finally, because it is part of the document model, \code {Message}
has a \code {forward_flag} as part of its function definition, to
allow for the observer to take the direction of execution of the
transaction to be taken into account. The semantic of backward
for a \code {Message} data depends on the semantic of the model.
The only rule is to have the proper behavior if the transaction
containing the \code {Message} is refused by the server so rollbacked
locally, or the meaning of undoing a transaction when the transaction
contains operations over a \code {Message}.


\subsection [id=signal] {\code {Signal}}

On the other hand, \link [id=reference/Signal] {\code {Signal}}
is not a flip type. It also does not store
data, and the data is not shared between other clients. It is not part of the
document model.

When a \code {Signal} is signalled, the content of the data is shared only with
every documents connected through a \code {Hub} on the local machine,
and the data itself is not saved within the document.

A \code {Signal} describes a signal directed to a flip Object.

Receiving the data sent is done with the help of a signal connection which
is outside the model, and is not received through the \code {document_changed}
virtual method of the observer. Therefore it is not synchronous to changes
of the model.

Because of the way it internally works, \code {Signal} is also preferred
when the amount of data to exchange per second can be enormous.

Let's take the previous example and let's say that the realtime position
of the playhead (not the one reflected in the model) is going to be signaled
from the audio engine to the GUI using a \code {Signal}.

When the play head is constructed, the observer of the GUI will set up
a signal connection to receive the realtime position, as illustrated below.

\codeblock [language=c++] ***
class PlayHead : public Object
{
public:
   enum
   {
      Signal_RT_POSITION = 0,
   };

   PlayHead () : signal_rt_position (Signal_RT_POSITION, *this) {}

   Signal <double> signal_rt_position;
};

void  document_changed (PlayHead & playhead)
{
   if (playhead.added ())
   {
      // Store the SignalConnection in an entity

      playhead.entity ().emplace <SignalConnection> (
         playhead.signal_rt_position.connect ([](double position){
            // update realtime position in the GUI
         });
      );
   }

   if (playhead.removed ())
   {
      playhead.entity ().erase <SignalConnection> ();
   }
}

// From audio engine :

double position = audio_engine.get_rt_position ();

playhead.signal_rt_position (position);
***

The signal also decouple the sender from the receiver, in the sense
that the sender does not need to know who is going to receive the
data, and even is the data is going to be received at all.

This is also a safe mechanism, if an object is already deleted in
a document, while still present in another document : if the signal
does not have a recipient anymore, it is silently dropped.
