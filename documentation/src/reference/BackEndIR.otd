\class {BackEndIR}
\header {flip/BackEndIR.h}
\declaration ***
class BackEndIR;
***

\code {flip::BackEndIR} represents an intermediate representation of
the document. Instead of directly to matching to flip class members,
this objects holds class and attribute names as strings, allowing
to modify this representation before it is fed to the document.

The object holds the full document in memory.

This class is used to :

\itemize {
\item {Read and write a document stored on a media}
\item {Convert from one revision of the document model to another one}
\item {Make the difference between two documents and make a transaction out of it,
   which allows to produce 3-way merges}
}

\method {register_backend}
\brief {Registers a concrete format backend for reading}

\codeblock [language=c++] ***
template <class BackEnd>
void  register_backend ();
***

Register a concrete format backend such as \link [id=BackEndBinary] {\code {BackEndBinary}}
or \link [id=BackEndMl] {\code {BackEndMl}}. Registering will allow this object to
guess the format of the backend and do proper parsing.

The subsequent call to \code {read} will use all backends registered to this object.

Example:

\codeblock [language=c++] ***
// DataProviderMemory provider;

BackEndIR backend;
backend.register_backend <BackEndBinary> (); (1)
backend.read (provider);                     (2)
***

\enumerate {
\item {Add \code {BackEndBinary} to the list of registered back end types to consider for reading}
\item {Read document given provider. In this case the backend will only use \code {BackEndBinary} for reading}
}

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\method {read}
\brief {Reads from the provider and fill this object. Returns \code {true} \emph {iff} the operation was successful}

\codeblock [language=c++] ***
bool  read (DataProviderBase & provider);
***

Reads from the provider and fill the intermediate representation of the document
stored in this object.

Returns \code {true} \emph {iff} the operation was successful.

See \link [id=BackEndMl] {\code {BackEndMl}} or
\link [id=BackEndBinary] {\code {BackEndBinary}}
for an example of use of this method.

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\method {write}
\brief {Writes to the consumer using the specified backend in the template parameter}

\codeblock [language=c++] ***
template <class BackEnd>
void  write (DataConsumerBase & consumer);
***

Writes the intermediate representation of the document to the consumer
using the specified backend in the template parameter.

Example:

\codeblock [language=c++] ***
// DataConsumerMemory consumer;

backend.write <BackEndBinary> (consumer);
***

See \link [id=BackEndMl] {\code {BackEndMl}} or
\link [id=BackEndBinary] {\code {BackEndBinary}}
for a more detailed example of use of this method.

\brief {Reads from this object and fill the document}

\codeblock [language=c++] ***
void  read (DocumentBase & document);
***

exactly as if executing a transaction. Changed made to the document should
then be commited.

See \link [id=BackEndMl] {\code {BackEndMl}} or
\link [id=BackEndBinary] {\code {BackEndBinary}}
for an example of use of this method.
