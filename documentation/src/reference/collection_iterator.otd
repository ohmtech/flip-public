\code {collection_iterator} satisfies the \code {BidirectionalIterator} C++ concept.
It is a generic iterator that can be used to iterate other any specialization
of template class \code {Collection}.

All specializations of template class \code {Collection} inherit from \code {CollectionBase}
which has the methods \code {gbegin}, \code {gcbegin}, \code {gend}, \code {gcend}
which return iterators of type \code {collection_iterator} or \code {const_collection_iterator}.

\division {Miscellaneous}

\method {key}
\brief {Returns the key associated to the iterator.}

\codeblock [language=c++] ***
const KeyRandom & key () const;
***

Returns the key associated to the iterator.

The key is guaranteed unique in the container.

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\method {added}
\brief {Returns \code {true} \emph {iff} the iterator was added to the container.}

\codeblock [language=c++] ***
bool added () const;
***

Returns \code {true} \emph {iff} the iterator was added to the container.

\note {When an object is moved in the container, then the destination iterator is considered
as added while the object is considered as resident.
See \link [id=Collection.iterator] {Collection::iterator} for an example of it.
}

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\method {removed}
\brief {Returns \code {true} \emph {iff} the iterator was removed to the container.}

\codeblock [language=c++] ***
bool removed () const;
***

Returns \code {true} \emph {iff} the iterator was removed to the container.

\note {When an object is moved in the container, then the source iterator is considered
as removed while the object is considered as resident.
See \link [id=Collection.iterator] {Collection::iterator} for an example of it.
}

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\method {resident}
\brief {Returns \code {true} \emph {iff} the iterator was neither added or removed.}

\codeblock [language=c++] ***
bool resident () const;
***

Returns \code {true} \emph {iff} the iterator was neither added or removed.
